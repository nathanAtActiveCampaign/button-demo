# Camp Design System

## ActiveCampaign's visual language

Camp Design System is the visual language we use to communicate ActiveCampaignâ€™s identity, values, and user experience. It is the foundational styles and components on which we build ActiveCampaign and is the design bridge between our brand and our platform.

Our goal is to drive consistency throughout our products as we grow, making it easier to scale both design and engineering. Camp is a set of components, tools, and resources that help build and maintain consistency with ease.

## Camp tokens

Camp design tokens are the smallest unit of design within ActiveCampaign, otherwise known as our styles. 

Color, typography, space, border, depth, and motion are used in design tools as well as code of any tech stack, including both web and mobile.
